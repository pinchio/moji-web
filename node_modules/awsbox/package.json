AWS also provides a\nfull set of APIs that make it possible to programatically allocate servers.\nFinally, AWS offers the ability to create \"template\" instances (Amazon Machine\nImages) that are VM snapshots.\n\n*The problem:* For small scale nodejs projects, there's a lot of\nadministrative boiler plate work that one must to set up a machine.\nYou must install web server software, set up security policies and network\naccess, copy up your keypair, determine how you'll deploy your software on the\nnew VM, etc.\n\n\"Platform as a service\" providers like heroku make most of these decisions for\nyou, providing a demand spun \"vm-like\" thing that you can deploy code on by\nadhering to a couple conventions and `git pushing`.  Where heroku breaks down\nis in *generativity* - you are limited to doing things that heroku has thought\nof, and when you want to do something custom (install a new native software\nlibrary, run an experimental database for which you cannot find a third party\nhosted provider) - you are screwed.\n\nAlso, heroku is relatively expensive.  The moment you want to run two\nprocesses, you're paying 0.05$/hr for that process vs. on aws where\nyou can purchase a \"micro\" instance for 0.02$/hr for the whole VM.\nThe final area of expense is in \"add-ons\" - service providers that offer\nthings like hosted databases, email sending, etc.  A small scale database\ncan cost another .015$/hr.\n\nBut Wait!  What about [nodejitsu]?  Well, probably use them: they're\nawesome, smart, admirably share their work, have a free service for\nnon-commercial deployments, and *just work* for most apps.  But\nsometimes you might want full control.  That you?  Read on...  (NOTE:\nawsbox is *built* on lots of nodejistu stuffs).\n\n  [nodejitsu]: http://nodejitsu.com/\n\nSo what we maybe want is the convenience of Nodejitsu and Heroku, and the\npricing and freedom of a raw amazon image...\n\n*The solution:* **awsbox** is a set of nodejs scripts, a command line utility,\nand a template image (AMI).  Together it allows you to deploy a new server\nfrom the command line that is pre-configured to run your Node.JS service.\n\n## Features\n\n  * **nodejs focused** - While other stacks could be supported in the future,\n    awsbox is laser focused on node.js to start.\n  * **full root access** - awsbox just gets you started, after that you can do\n    Whatever You Want.\n  * **magic ssh key config** - Your SSH key will be copied up and installed for you.\n  * **git push support** - After you provision a vm, it's pre-configured so you can\n    push to deploy\n  * **multi-region support** - awsbox base AMIs are published in every region AWS\n    supports, so you can deploy anywhere.\n  * **command line or programmatic usage** - type at it, or script it.\n  * **OS level user isolation** - all deployed code is run with user permissions under\n    a single account.\n  * **HTTP forwarding with custom 503 page** - [nginx] is pre-configured to forward\n    requests to your nodejs process bound to a local port.\n  * **SSL support** - By default your process runs with a self-signed cert.  Enabling\n    SSL support is as easy as copying up a private key and certificate in [PEM] format.\n  * **WebSocket support** - AWSBOX fully supports WebSockets, via [socket.io] or otherwise.\n  * **Route53 support** - manage your DNS from the command line, and have DNS set up for\n    your boxes at creation time.\n\n  [nginx]: https://nginx.org\n  [PEM]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509\n  [socket.io]: http://socket.io\n\n## Get Started\n\nStart by working through [the tutorial].  Then have a look at the [Hello World] sample app.\nAnd after that, check out [the documentation] in this repository.\n\n  [the tutorial]: https://github.com/mozilla/awsbox/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md\n  [Hello World]: https://github.com/lloyd/awsbox-helloworld\n  [the documentation]: https://github.com/mozilla/awsbox/tree/master/doc\n",
